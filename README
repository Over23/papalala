This is the papalala irssi-based IRC bot platform. That means,
a collection of irssi scripts providing various IRC services, and some
supporting infrastructure.

To run this thing, symlink everything in irssi/ to ~/.irssi/ and run
irssi from the root directory of this tree.

irssi/         - the scripts themselves

build_brain.pl - Megahal training from logs (by default, Megahal is
                 trained from conversations with it)
filter_logs.pl - Megahal log preprocessing for build_brain.pl
update_ban.pl  - Megahal automatic word banlist extraction from logs
megahal_tcp.pl - Megahal server for the megahal script; must be running
                 for Megahal to work

wordstats.sql  - SQL schema for the wordstats script; feed sqlite to
                 initialize the database
wordstats_import.pl - Import eggdrop mod_stats to wordstats database

IDOS.pm        - classes for the idos script
