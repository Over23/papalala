This is the papalala irssi-based IRC bot platform. That means,
a collection of irssi scripts providing various IRC services, and some
supporting infrastructure.

To run this thing, symlink everything in irssi/ to ~/.irssi/ and run
irssi from the root directory of this tree. (or run: irssi --home $WHERE)
