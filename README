This is the papalala irssi-based IRC bot platform. That means,
a collection of irssi scripts providing various IRC services, and some
supporting infrastructure.

To run this thing, symlink everything in irssi/ to ~/.irssi/ and run instance of
irssi from the root directory of this tree. (or run: irssi --home $WHERE).
Config of bot itself than is mostly managed by config of irssi instance (e.g. /nick will set bot's name).
Check if you have at least autorun scripts started, most of them have some dependency to perl, and you will 
see it, when you will do /script load.
Nice way how to install cpan 
[eg. yum install perl-CPAN.x86_64; cpan CPAN; cpan XXX where XXX is missing perl dependency]

Best way to learn chatbot new words is using hailo command bundled with 
Hailo perl module [cpan Hailo], just be sure to save brain in $IRSSIHOME/papalala.brn

irssi/         - the scripts themselves

wordstats.sql  - SQL schema for the wordstats script; feed sqlite to
                 initialize the database
wordstats_import.pl - Import eggdrop mod_stats to wordstats database

IDOS.pm        - classes for the idos script
